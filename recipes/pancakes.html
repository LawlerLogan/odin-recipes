        <li>
            Dry ingredients: Combine flour, sugar,
            baking powder, and salt in a large bowl.
        </li>
        <li>
            Wet ingredients: Beat the buttermilk,
            milk, eggs, and melted butter together
            in a seperate bowl. Do not combine the
            wet and dry ingredients until right before
            you cook the pancakes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Making the pancakes: Add the wet
            ingredients to the dry ingredients and mix
            with a wooden spoon or fork until the
            mixtures are just-blended. Scoop the batter
            onto a hot, oiled griddle and cook until
            the pancake is bubbly on the top. Flip with
            a spatula and cook until both sides are a
            golden brown.
