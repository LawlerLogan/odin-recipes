    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        <em>Omelets</em> are a very filling item on many
        different culture's palettes. High in protein,
        these golden semicircles will brighten your morning.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li> 
        <li>3 large eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon crumbled goat cheese</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped chives</li>
        <li>Sea salt and ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium
            heat, swiriling oil to coat skillet. Pour
            beaten eggs into hot skillet and cook until
            eggs bubble and begin to firm up.
        </li>
        <li>
            Lift the cooked edges of omelet with a rubber
            spatula and tilt the skillet so any uncooked
            egg runs underneath the lifted edge. Continue
            cooking, lifting the edges and tilting the 
            skillet, until omelet is almost completely
            set, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove the skillet from
            heat. Spread any runny eggs evenly over the
            top of omelet using the spatula.
        </li>
        <li>
            Sprinkle goat cheese, 1 ½ teaspoons chives, sea
            salt, and black pepper over omelet. Gently
            lift one edge and fold ⅓ of the omelet into
            the center. Slide omelet to the edge of the 
            skillet and flip, folded-side down, onto a
            plate.
        </li>
        <li>
            Top the omelet with the remaining ½ teaspoon
            chives to serve.
        </li>
    </ol>
